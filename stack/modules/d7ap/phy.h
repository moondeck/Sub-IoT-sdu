/** \brief Initiate a packet transmission over the air with the specified TX settings.
 *
 * This function sends the packet pointed to by the packet parameter over the air. Packets are always 
 * transmitted using the tx_cfg settings in the tx_meta field of the supplied packet. If these settings are 
 * not valid, EINVAL is returned and the packet is not transmitted. Moreover the 'length' field of the packet 
 * must also be properly configured. More specifically, the radio will send the first 'length' bytes of the 
 * packet's 'data' buffer over the air. It is the responsibility of the caller to ensure that the 'length' of 
 * the packet has been properly configured.
 *
 * Packet transmission is always done *asynchronously*, that is: a packet transmission is initiated by a call 
 * to this function, but is not completed until the tx_packet_callback_t function supplied to the 
 * hw_radio_init function is invoked by the radio driver. If this function is 0x0, no callback will occur. 
 * In that case the user must check that the transmission has finished by querying the hw_radio_tx_busy 
 * function. The packet buffer supplied to this function *MUST* remain available until the transmission has 
 * been completed. It should be noted that the tx_callback function will ONLY be called if this function 
 * pointer != 0x0 and the hw_radio_send_packet function returns SUCCESS.
 *
 * If a transmission is initiated while the radio is in IDLE mode, the radio switches directly from IDLE mode to 
 * TX mode to transmit the packet. After the packet has been sent, it switches back to IDLE mode (unless 
 * hw_radio_set_rx() is called while the TX is in progress).
 *
 * If a transmission is initiated while the radio is in RX mode, the radio switches immediately to TX mode to 
 * transmit the packet. If a packet reception is in progress while this function is called, this packet is 
 * dropped. Once the packet has been sent, the radio switches back to IDLE mode , unless hw_radio_set_rx() is
 * called while the TX is still in progress.

 *
 * \return error_t	SUCCESS if the packet transmission has been successfully initiated.
