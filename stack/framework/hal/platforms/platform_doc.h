 *
 * \brief A platform defines a combination of an MCU type, an RF chip, optional other chips and the wiring on the board.
 * 	This means there is one platform defined for each type of board.
 *
 * The platform is responsible for initializing the MCU and other chips, bootstrapping the framework and finally start the scheduler loop.
 * For example the pins used for UART, SPI, LEDs etc are defined here. The main() function should be implemented here.
