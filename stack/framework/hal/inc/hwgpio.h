 * \brief Hardware interface to the GPIO Pins of the MCU of the platform.
 *
 * This header files specifies a number of generic functions for accessing 
 * and configuring individual General Purpose IO pins of the MCU.
 *
 * The GPIO interface allows different pieces of code to interact with 
 * the MCU's GPIO pins in different manners.
 *
 * This interface allows:
 *   - The MCU to provide a generic, platform independent, interface 
 *     to the GPIO pins
 *
 *   - Chip drivers / 'high level' users to:
 *       - Get/Set/Clear specific IO pins
 *       - Configure callbacks to be called for specific GPIO events
 *     In an MCU/Platform independent manner
 *
 *   - Platform integrators to:
 *	 - Decide which pins are available
 *	 - Wire specific IO pins to specific peripherals
 *	 - Configure individual pins as input / output
 *	 - Do 'advanced' PIN configuration on MCU's that support it
 *	   (such as the EFM32gg)
 *
 * Each GPIO pin of the MCU is identified with a unique 'pin_id_t'.
 * The pin_id's for the GPIO pins are defined by the MCU and made available
 * to chip drivers & user functions through the platform-specific "platform.h"
 * header file. These pin_id's can then be passed to the functions defined below
 * to interact with individual GPIO pins.
 *

/*! \brief Configure an interrupt to occur when a rising or falling event occurs
 *	  on a specific GPIO pin.
 *
 * GPIO interrupts cannot be configured for all GPIO pins. Whether or not a GPIO
 * interrupt can be configured depends on how the pin was configured by the platform
 * (ie: the call to hw_gpio_configure_pin). In general however, a GPIO interrupt can only be
 * configured for GPIO pins that have been configured as 'input' pins. When this function
 * is called for a GPIO pin that does not support interrupts, this is signalled to the caller
 * by returning EOFF.
 *
 * Interrupts can be scheduled both for 'rising edge' and 'falling edge' events. Although 
 * this function allows both 'rising' and 'falling' events to be captured for the same 
 * GPIO pin at the same time, it should  be noted that this is not supported by all 
 * MCU's (the msp430 for instance does not support this). If a GPIO interrupt is configured
 * for both a rising and a falling event while this is not supported, EINVAL is returned.
 *
 * This function can be called multiple times to alter the event_mask of the events to capture.
 * The callback function however MUST match the function of the first call to this function (for 
 * a specific GPIO pin). If the callback function doesn't match, EBUSY is returned.
 *
 * Please note that configuring the event does not automatically enable it. The interrupt must
 * be enabled through a separate call to hw_gpio_enable_interrupt. If the interrupt was 
 * previously enabled by a call to hw_gpio_enable_interrupt, it is disabled by a call to 
 * this function.
 *
 * \param pin_id	The id of the GPIO pin on which to configure the interrupt
 * \param event_mask	A bitmask of the events that should be captured. The event_mask can
 *			be one of three values:
 *			  - 0: no events will be captured
 *			  - GPIO_RISING_EDGE: capture rising edge events only
 *			  - GPIO_FALLING_EDGE: capture falling edge events only
 *			  - (GPIO_RISING_EDGE | GPIO_FALLING_EDGE): capture both
 *				rising and falling edge events.
 *	\param callback	The function to call when the interrupt occurs. Please note that
 *			this function is called from an interrupt context and that all processing
 *			should therefore be as minimal as possible.
 *	\param arg The parameter to pass to the callback function.
 *	\return error_t	SUCCESS if the GPIO interrupt was configured successfully
 *			EOFF if the selected GPIO pin does not support GPIO interrupts
 *			EINVALID if the MCU does not support the event_mask specified
 *			         or if the supplied callback is 0x0
 *			EBUSY if the callback function does not match the callback
 *			      function of an earlier call to this function

 * If needed, it can also be used from application code to enable additional GPIO pins
 * at run-time, but this is extremely discouraged.
 *
 * In general, a GPIO pin can be configured for 'input', 'output' or 'both', but much 
 * more advanced configurations are also possible. Since the various  options available 
 * for configuring a GPIO pin are inherently tied the used MCU, and the hardware platform
 * on which the MCU resides, it is impossible to configure the GPIO pins without prior 
 * knowledge of which MCU is used.
 *
 * Because of this, this function is not declared here but must be instead declared in one
 * of the 'public' headers of the MCU used. See the documentation of this function for the
 * specific MCU used for more information.
