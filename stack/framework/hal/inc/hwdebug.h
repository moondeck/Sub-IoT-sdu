 * \brief The interface to the debug pins of the device. 
 *
 * A debug pin is a GPIO pin that has been configured
 * as an output pin and whose state (up/down) can be controlled through this interface.
 *
 * The application is able to signal specific events through this interface which can then be captured
 * through the use of an external logic analyzer or oscilloscope.
 *
 * The amount of debug pins available, and their wiring to external pins on the board itself,
 * depends on the specific hardware platform used. A platform is not required to provide any hardware
 * debugging capabilities, in which case calls to the functions defined in this file are ignored.

 * to a pin is '0' it is cleared.

 * On platforms that allow multiple GPIO pins to be configured with a single instruction, all the pins in the mask are
 * set/cleared at the same time. If this is not supported, the pins are configured iteratively
