/*! \brief Put the system in low power mode
 *
 * When the system is in low power mode the CPU is halted until it
 * receives an external trigger (usually an interrupt).
 *
 * The low power mode to enter is selected by supplying the mode
 * parameter. 
 *
 * In low power mode zero (mode == 0) the CPU itself is disabled but all 
 * hardware peripherals are required to remain available. (This usually corresponds to 
 * the most power hungry low power mode of the MCU).
 *
 * The HAL is only required to support (mode == 0) but other low power modes (mode > 0) 
 * may be available, depending on the specific platform. In general these additional 
 * low power modes trade energy usage for the (un)availability of certain peripherals. 
 * By convention, higher values for the 'mode' parameter select lower power modes. 
 * The exact definition of each additional low power mode however, depends on the 
 * specific platform.
 *
 * \param mode  The low power mode to enter. Defaults to 0

 * number of the MCU.
 *
 * By convention the bytes of the ID should be ordered in such a way as to minimise the risk of 
 * a collision in the event that the ID is truncated.
 * 
 * If, for instance, the ID is generated based on an MCU specific part_number and a device specific 
 * serial_number, the bits of the serial_number should be placed in the least significant bits of the 
 * returned ID.
