/*! \brief Initialise the watchdog
 *
 *  This function initialises the watchdog of the selected MCU. This function is NOT part of the
 *  'user' HAL API and should only be called from the initialisation code of the specific platform.
 *  The configuration of the watchdog is hardcoded in the platform (for now).
 *  After calling this function the watchdog timer is enabled and should be resetted periodically using hw_watchdog_feed().
 *  Failing to do so before the timer elapses results in MCU reset.
