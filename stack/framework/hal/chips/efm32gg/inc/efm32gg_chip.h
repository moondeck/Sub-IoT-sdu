/* \brief Implementation of hw_gpio_configure_pin for the EFM32gg MCU
 *
 * This function supports all pin configuration modes available through the
 * 'GPIO_PinModeSet' function in emlib.
 *
 * It should be noted that the EFM32gg only has a single interrupt bit for each pin id
 * and that only a single GPIO port can be selected for each pin id. This means that it is,
 * for instance not possible to configure an interrupt both for in A3 and D3 since these pins share
 * the same pin id (3 in this case) but are wired on different ports. A3 and D4 do not conflict
 * because they have a different pin id.
 *
 * Because of this, this function also requires the user to explicitly choose whether or not
 * interrupts can be enabled for a specific pin through the <int_allowed> parameter.
 * If <int_allowed> is true for the given pin, the interrupts can later be configured
 * through 'hw_gpio_configure_interrupt'. Otherwise, 'hw_gpio_configure_interrupt' will
 * always return EOFF for the given pin.
 *
 * When this function is called with <int_allowed> set to true, after interrupts have been
 * explicitly allowed for a conflicting pin, this function will return EBUSY and the gpio port
 * will not be configured.
 *
 * \param pin_id(pin_id_t)		The pin_id of the GPIO pin to configure
 * \param int_allowed(bool)		Whether or not to allow interrupts for this pin
 * \param mode(GPIO_Mode_TypeDef)	The mode for the GPIO pin (see EFM32gg docs for more information)
 * \param out(unsigned int)		The out value for the GPIO pin (see EFM32gg docs for more information)
 *
 * \return	SUCCESS if the pin was configured successfully
 *		EBUSY if <int_allowed> is true and interrupts were already allowed for a conflicting pin
