 * @{
 * \brief The framework timer provides an abstraction of the low-level hardware timers provided by the HAL. 
 * 		The framework timer interface builds on the low-level HAL timer interface to provide more advanced capabilities. 
 * 
 * The major differences with the HAL timers are:
 *  - 32-bit counter instead of a 16-bit counter
 *  - Multiple timer events can be scheduled simultaneously
 *  - Events are executed by the scheduler in the main task loop and NOT during the timer interrupt
 *  - Support for multiple priorities
 *
 * The framework timer supports the same timer resolutions supported by the hal. By default
 * a binary millisecond timer interval is used (HWTIMER_FREQ_MS), but this can be changed
 * by setting the FRAMEWORK_TIMER_RESOLUTION property in CMake.
 *
 * The 32-bit counter of the timer (see timer_get_counter()) counts from 0 to MAX_INT
 * and then loops back to zero. Depending on the selected frequency this yield a loop time between
 * 1,5 days (32KHz timer) and 48 days (1MS ticks). timer_get_counter_value() therefore always
 * returns the time since system bootup (or since the last overflow)

/*! \brief Post a task to be scheduled at a given time with a given priority
 *
 * The time parameter denotes the clock tick at which the task is to be scheduled
 * with the task scheduler. time may be a value that is in the future or in the past wrt.
 * the current value of 'timer_get_counter_value()' (denoted as cur_time).
 * If time denotes a clock tick in the future, the framework timer delays scheduling the task until
 * cur_time == time. If time denotes a clock tick in the past, the task is scheduled
 * immediately. Depending on the frequency of the timer, the priority of the task and the amount of tasks
 * currently scheduled, another few clock ticks may pass before the task is actually executed.
 * (If you need more precise timing, use a hardware timer)
 *
 * To ensure proper operation of the framework timer in the event of an overflow, time is
 * interpreted in a circular fashion wrt. the current counter value. A specified time is deemed
 * to be in the past when, using SIGNED integer arithmetic: 'time - cur_time < 0'.
 * This equates to checking whether time < cur_time, except that it also works when the timer is about
 * to overflow.
 *
 * Please note that posting a task with the framework timers does NOT automatically register
 * it with the scheduler. If the posted task is not registered with the scheduler, the task
 * will not be executed.
