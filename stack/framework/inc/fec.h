 * \brief Implements the FEC Encoder used for error correction
 *
 * FEC makes sense when operating near the sensitivity limit.
 * This is a technique used for controlling errors in data transmission over unreliable or noisy communication channels.
 * FEC is accomplished by adding redundancy to the transmitted information.
 *
 * Channel errors tend to occur in bursts. FEC is associated with an interleaver. Interleaving ameliorates this problem by shuffling source symbols across several code words, thereby creating a more uniform distribution of errors.
